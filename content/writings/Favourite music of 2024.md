For one more year, I will be compiling my favourite projects released this year. Albums and EPs count, singles do not. Projects that I really want to highlight will be marked with a (*). [Here the 2022 list](https://i.imgur.com/Hnu0y4C.jpg) and [the 2023 one]([[Favourite music of 2023]]). I will also try to add links and some words on the projects that deserve them.

This year was a bit special since I also launched a blog just to review and talk about music with some friends. It's called [no-cosign](https://no-cosign.m19182.dev/) and it's written in spanish. I have already released 3 posts there and I'm a bit proud of them so check them out if that's your thing and subscribe to the newsletter.
